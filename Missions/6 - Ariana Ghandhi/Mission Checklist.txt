A man chooses, a slave obeys. ~ Andrew Ryan

=== [[[ Verbal Briefing ]]]  === 




Please people, stay seated! Welcome to Laghisola! I'm Andrew Ryan from the ISA and I'll be running this operation. Before we begin, please exercise yourself with the current state of affairs in this region from this news article you should receive directly in your tabs.... now! <<< EXECUTE LOCAL NEWS >>> The Russians and the Grozovians have cozied up a lot over the past few years... so cozy that the Russians basically gave this island up to the Grozovians in exchange for resource rights, mutual military collaboration, and bi-lateral defense agreement. Using their powerful-friends, the Grozovian government decided to launch a full fledged 'ethinic cleansing' against the local population, throwing the nation into a civil war. This has led to an humanitarian crisis, with a bit of UN intervention to help stabilize the region. Unfortunately, an American journalist reporting on these incidents got caught in the crossfire and went missing, presumed to be 'kidnapped' by the Grozovian Armed Forces along with 4 UN Officers and you are here to rescue them all. Atleast, thats how we are projecting and will continue to project the story. The real reason you are here for is that 2 months ago, the brightest and greatest minds in the United States launched six of our latest experimental project "AERIS", which stands for Autonomous Experimental Reconnaissance and Intelligence System. Its a system used to provide realtime intelligence and stealth payload delivery on American interests without them ever knowing about it. To put it bluntly and clearly, its a goddamn stealth rocket with very low fingerprint of being detected. Now the problem is, 3 of the "AERIS" seems to have malfunctioned and due to an engineering error, the latitudes and longitutes were mixed up, causing them to land here. We sent a 4-man covert team posing as 'UN Officers' with necessary equipment to try and divert the landing process, but we lost contact with them as soon as they confirmed and relayed the accurate landing positions in the island. With time running out, we've decided to intervene in the island militarily to ensure the safety and integrity of the project from the Grozovian government and by proxy, Russia. Our intel also indicates that the Grozovian Armed Forces are gearing up for a battle though, its not confirmed, they are likely preparing against our intervention.

The interdiction team was able to accurately estimate the landing times of each craft codenamed 'Uniform', 'Alpha', and 'Victor' respectively. 'Victor' would be the first craft landing at its dropsite in less than 20 minutes from now. As per our satellite intelligence, the island has some manned and autonomous defenses, but is mostly guarded by infantry and is the easiest site to secure compared to the other two. The island is also home to the central prison where PoWs from rebel factions and other innocently convicted civilians are held. We believe that the Journalist and our undercover team are kept in that prison. We've marked Points of Interest Sierra and Omega, which could be housing the prisoners. There are also other prisoners that may aid us by taking up arms should you free them from their cells.

The second craft to land would be at dropsite 'Alpha'. DZ Alpha is a heavy resource area with plenty of oil fields and minerals. They have mobilized additional men, equipment, and defenses in the area. Expect strong resistance. The craft is estimated to land in about 30 minutes from now.

The third and final craft would be landing south of the GAF HQ Airbase. It was a heavily contested zone, now crawling with hostiles every 10 meters. Expect fierce resistance in this region. We anticipate the GAF to utilize their air assets to try and hinder your progress. The time for the landing is unclear but I'll let you know as soon as our emergency sensors goes online when it reaches the methosphere.

Remember, the GAF forces are well trained and have mobilized in mass numbers with their recent annexation of this island. Expect strong resistance. While your priority objectives are to secure the dropsites and by proxy the rockets, please, try to rescue the American Journalist and the UN Officers when you find them.

You are authorized to use lethal force and ignore any collateral damage anywhere except for the town of Esperan which is under UN control for this operation. The full might of the US Airforce is at your disposal including the ability to call in B-52 Bombers for bombing run in the region. (Do keep the airspace secured.) I recommend having atleast one CAP / Multirole in the air at all times.

Your initial insertion will be aided by a network disruption of all GAF anti-air / targeting stations, meaning, you should be able to touch down relatively safely before the GAF sends in their QRFs.

Please, if you have any questions, nows the time to ask.
