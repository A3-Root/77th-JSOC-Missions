The island of Laghisola, once a tranquil haven, has been thrust into chaos and conflict. Recently annexed by the Grozovian government, this strategic piece of land has become a focal point of military power. Partnering with Russia, the Grozovian regime has established a formidable military presence on the island. The collaboration has led to a grim campaign of ethnic cleansing, turning Laghisola into a fortified stronghold. The last remnants of the refugee population are now huddled in the town of Esperan, their existence threatened by constant violence.

Esperan, a town once known for its vibrant community, is now a battleground. Rebel groups, determined to resist the Grozovian occupation, clash frequently with the heavily armed Grozovian forces. Amidst this turmoil, the United Nations has managed to establish a small aid mission in Esperan, a beacon of hope in a sea of despair. However, the mission's efforts are hindered by the omnipresent threat of attack and the oppressive oversight of Russian forces.

Amid this backdrop of conflict, a new layer of mystery and urgency has been added. A covert team sent by US SOCCOM, disguised as UN Field Officers, was deployed to Laghisola to investigate an undisclosed issue of high importance involving experimental and advanced UAVs. This team, skilled and prepared, confirmed the coordinates of three critical sites before all contact was abruptly lost. The sites, code-named 'Dropsite Alpha,' 'Dropsite Victor,' and 'Dropsite Uniform,' have since remained shrouded in silence.

Compounding the crisis, an American journalist and their crew, who were documenting the humanitarian and military situation on the island, have also gone missing. Their last known location was within the volatile region surrounding Esperan. Fears grow that they have been captured by Grozovian forces, their fate uncertain.

To address this escalating crisis, the 77th JSOC has been mobilized. Under the guise of a search and rescue mission for the missing journalist and the 4 undercover UN field operatives, the 77th JSOC team will infiltrate the Laghisola islands. The primary goal is to locate and secure the three dropsites whose significance is closely guarded. While the official narrative focuses on the humanitarian aspect of rescuing the journalist, the underlying mission is of paramount importance.

Once the dropsites have been secured and the informations retrived from the UAVs, the team will then further investigate the disappearance of the UN field operatives and the journalists.
