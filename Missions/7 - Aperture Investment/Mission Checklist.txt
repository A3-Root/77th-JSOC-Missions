Verbal Briefing:

[ // Picture In Picture Advisory // ]

Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to Sanagasta!

36 hours ago, the POTUS met with Presidente Sanchez and has jointly designated Drug Cartels as Terrorist Organization. He is intending to show the American people his new stance towards 'War on Drugs' next week. However, he wants to present the American people some concrete action already taken to prove his commitment. As such, we are being deployed here to cause eliminate the senior leadership of the Sonora Cartel and disrupt their operations in the region.

However, about 12 hours ago, the Sonora Cartel launched a surprise offensive against the Mexican Federale bases in this region resulting in them taking over two FOBs and the Central Investigation base and loss of many Federales. This level of attack, coordination, and courage was never expected from the cartel proving that they are an adversary we shouldn't underestimate and a threat we must control.

Our objectives are simple. We have identified two Lieutenants pulling the shots in the region. First is Manuel 'Gatekeeper' Diaz - He handles the Security and Weapons of the cartel. The screen to my left is how he looks like. We can either capture him or kill him. The second is Silvio 'Borat' - He handles the finance and logistics of the cartel in the region. It is VITAL that we apprehend him to extract information of all the cartel activities and network both home and abroad. Both of these targets are well guarded so expect resistance.

Next we have to secure the two FOBs and CID bases lost and rescue any federale found. Try to find last collected intel and relay any you find so we can act further before the cartels launch their second wave of assault.

A no-fly zone has been enacted on the town to the south east of us for operational security.

SOAR will assist you in recon, transport and cas using the 6x Blackhawks and 3x Reaper drones.

With the recent attack, the cartel has bolstered its firepower, manning field AA trucks, police apcs, some T34s and some BTRs. An early reconnaissance and asset destruction is critical before Deltas can deploy next to these sites.

Extra Flashbangs are approved and recommended.

I'll take your questions now.


* Q & A *

Over to the Mission Commander.
