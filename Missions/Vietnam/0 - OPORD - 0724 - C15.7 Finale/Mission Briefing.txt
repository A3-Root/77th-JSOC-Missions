[b][align=left][size=150][u]1. Situation[/u][/size][/align][/b]


November 29th, 1972
Phoc Tuy Province, Vietnam

In the wake of our recent operation, the NVA's aggression has intensified. The attack on our convoy during the last mission underscored their determination and audacity. Despite the escort from FSB Melisa, we reached Nui Dat Airbase with significant casualties and equipment losses. MACV HQ has now issued a general retreat order, necessitating the evacuation of the entire region.

We will commence this operation from Nui Dat Airbase. The ARVN forces will assume control of our sectors and base defenses as we withdraw. It is crucial that we ensure a stable handover to the ARVN, whom we have trained rigorously. Our unit will be the penultimate to evacuate, as the NVA gears up for a major assault.







[b]1.a. Area of Interest[/b]

Northern regions of Phoc Tuy Province.

On the South Eastern coast of Vietnam, the province of Phoc Tuy is located a short distance from the capital of Saigon, in a spacious plain dominated by a large fortified airbase constructed by the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF).  It is a major supply base for the region and is essential to provide support to activities in the local region. The northern regions of Phuc Toy are mostly isolated villages with access from dirt roads that go from south to north. These villages are surrounded by dense forest and are currently under VC control.




[b]1.b. Area of Operations[/b]


[b]1.b.(1) Terrain:[/b] Dense forest, Dirt roads suited for vehicular transportation, sporadic clearings with open area villages, open area farmland, sporadic lakes and rivers to the west.


[b]1.b.(2) Weather:[/b] Early Morning Hours, No Fog, 26Â°C, Clear sky.

[b]1.c. Hostile Forces[/b]

1.c.(1) North Vietnamese Army (NVA)
Frontline North Vietnamese military forces, operating in organized and traditional units, typically conducting "conventional" warfare and attempting to capture territory and fortify positions that can be used to conduct operations to attack nearby Allied units.

1.c.(2) Viet Cong (VC)
The guerilla arm of the North Vietnamese war front, the Viet Cong guerillas utilize unconventional warfare to conduct hit and run attacks on allied positions, ambush and disrupt supply and essential functions of Allied military and South Vietnamese government organizations and otherwise attempt to hinder and harm all means of South Vietnam and allied forces continuing to conduct the war.



[b]1.d. Friendly Forces[/b]

1.d. (1) Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)
South Vietnamese military forces, typically equipped with American style rifles and uniforms, ARVN troops are trained in American maneuvers and are generally very reliable in the field.  Due to the nature of the conflict ARVN forces are less likely to take prisoners and more likely to not be taken prisoner themselves.  Very few instances of ARVN troops being turned to support NVA and Viet Cong forces have been reported

1.d. (2) Montagnard Indigenous Forces
Local Indigenous forces, the Montagnards are common to the mountainous interior of Vietnam, and are typically local tribes that are known to be hostile to the Viet Cong and NVA forces due to their harsh treatment of these disparate and isolated tribes.
