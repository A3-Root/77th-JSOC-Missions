[b][align=left][size=150][u]1. Situation[/u][/size][/align][/b]


November 29th, 1972
Phoc Tuy Province, Vietnam

FSB Grey has been our refuge for the past fortnight. With each passing day, the NVA forces tighten their grip, escalating the toll of lives sacrificed to defend this territory. Recognizing the futility of further resistance, the US Army has decided to initiate a comprehensive evacuation plan, extending from FSB Grey to all regions north of Phoc Tuy Province.

As the tides of battle shift, the NVA forces steadily advance, signaling the nearing conclusion of this prolonged standoff. In the northern regions, the Viet Cong has built up an extensive cadre and political organization that has reached into every town and village north of XA BINH BA. The roads are considered dangerous, subject to ambush and should only be passable with a heavy escort. The Viet Cong has established bases in the nearby mountains and jungles which will cause some trouble for the US troops returning from FSB Grey. Our company will be the last group of friendly forces to return to Nui Dat







[b]1.a. Area of Interest[/b]

Northern regions of Phoc Tuy Province.

On the South Eastern coast of Vietnam, the province of Phoc Tuy is located a short distance from the capital of Saigon, in a spacious plain dominated by a large fortified airbase constructed by the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF).  It is a major supply base for the region and is essential to provide support to activities in the local region. The northern regions of Phuc Toy are mostly isolated villages with access from dirt roads that go from south to north. These villages are surrounded by dense forest and are currently under VC control.

[b]1.b.(1) Terrain:[/b] Dense forest, Dirt roads suited for vehicular transportation, sporadic clearings with open area villages, open area farmland, sporadic lakes and rivers to the west.


[b]1.b.(2) Weather:[/b] Early Morning Hours, Light Fog, 26°C, Moderate to heavy rainfall

[b]1.c. Hostile Forces[/b]

1.c.(1) North Vietnamese Army (NVA)
Frontline North Vietnamese military forces, operating in organized and traditional units, typically conducting "conventional" warfare and attempting to capture territory and fortify positions that can be used to conduct operations to attack nearby Allied units.

1.c.(2) Viet Cong (VC)
The guerilla arm of the North Vietnamese war front, the Viet Cong guerillas utilize unconventional warfare to conduct hit and run attacks on allied positions, ambush and disrupt supply and essential functions of Allied military and South Vietnamese government organizations and otherwise attempt to hinder and harm all means of South Vietnam and allied forces continuing to conduct the war.



[b]1.d. Friendly Forces[/b]

1.d. (1) Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)
South Vietnamese military forces, typically equipped with American style rifles and uniforms, ARVN troops are trained in American maneuvers and are generally very reliable in the field.  Due to the nature of the conflict ARVN forces are less likely to take prisoners and more likely to not be taken prisoner themselves.  Very few instances of ARVN troops being turned to support NVA and Viet Cong forces have been reported

1.d. (2) Montagnard Indigenous Forces
Local Indigenous forces, the Montagnards are common to the mountainous interior of Vietnam, and are typically local tribes that are known to be hostile to the Viet Cong and NVA forces due to their harsh treatment of these disparate and isolated tribes.
